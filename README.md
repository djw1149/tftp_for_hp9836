# TFTP

This is an implementation of TFTP (trivial file transfer program) for HP 9836 Pascal.
I wrote it in the beginning of my second semester of my sophmore year at CMU.
Approximately 30 hours of work in about two weeks while taking a full CMU ECE course load.

This code relied upon some specialized hardware built by CMU ECE.
It also uses a lot of HP Pascal special "pragmas" to allow it to do IP packet manipulation.
